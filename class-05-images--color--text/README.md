## Lab Assignment

Today's lab has two parts. One is a 'one-off' assignment. It is not directly connected to your weekly project, and is another pair-programming exercise.

The concepts covered in today's lab (functions that receive input and return output) will be very helpful for you in next week's project.

The second part of the assignment is to finish and deploy your Guessing Game. See the lab README for more details on both parts.
